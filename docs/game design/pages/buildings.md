# Buildings
Buildings are a core aspect of the game, they allow the player to add structures to the map in order to fight against incoming enemies.
All buildings will have an initial cost required to place them in the map, a hitbox, and a set of upgrades that changes from building to building. They can also be sold, recouping a percentage (50% ?) of the total gold spent on them.


## Tower
Towers are the main offensive building, they shoot arrows at enemies within their range.

They can receive upgrades such as: more damage, attack speed, range, projectile speed, crit chance, crit multiplier, pierce, chain, etc. Full list to be defined.
All upgrades will have a level limit, but one upgrade per tower will be able to exceed it's limit by two levels, providing an extraordinary bonus depending on the stat the player choses to limit break.

When certain conditions are met, towers can evolve into a unique tower. For example, if a tower has max level attack speed and limit breaks chain, it becomes a lightning tower.
These unique upgrades may also require some items dropped at random by the enemies, forcing the player to improvise based on the items they get instead of being able to plan everything ahead of time.


## Castle
The castle is a unique building, it cannot be bought or sold. Instead, it's already in it's designed place at the beginning of the game.
Unlike other buildings, the castle has health points that will be lowered when an enemy collides with it.
It also shoots arrows just like towers do, and can receive the same upgrades, plus additional upgrades that only make sense for a castle, such as regeneration of increased armor.


## Gold mine
Gold mines are support buildings that provide the player with an additional source of income. They cannot attack enemies, and their upgrades affect how and when the player receives extra resources.


## Other buildings
Other buildings can be added to the game. Like something buffing the towers around it, enabling certain unique tower upgrades, etc. More building variety would put more pressure on map real estate, making each building placed more meaningful.
