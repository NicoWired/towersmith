# Economy
The player gains gold by killing enemies, which will grant a specific amount based on their tier and special powers.
Gold is spent buying building and upgrading existing ones. Every upgrade should be more expensive than the previous one, even if they increase power by the same amount, and upgrading a tower to twice it's power should be more costly than buying a new one. The reasoning behing this, is that by placing a new tower the player is not only spending gold, but also real estate. Optimizing existing buildings without taking new land should come at a premium.

Additional currencies can be added to enable unique tower upgrades, and they can even be a requirement for limit breaking. TBD.
There could be a currency to get account wide bufss, like "all your towers deal 5% increased damage, on all levels forever", leading to account progression over time.
