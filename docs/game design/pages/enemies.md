# Enemies
Enemies will spawn at one or more predetermined points in the map, and will follow a predetermined path that leads to the castle. If they reach it, they will deal damage to the castle and then disappear.

Enemies have the following stats:
- Speed: How fast they move towards the castle.
- Damage: How much damage they deal once they reach the castle.
- Bounty: How much gold they reward when they're killed.
- Health: Damage they can withstand before dying.

More stats can be added to make enemies feel more diverse. For example, armor, dodge, movement style, etc.
Enemies can have power ups in the later waves, like healing aura, speed up aura, resist one hit, etc.

There are 3 enemy types:
- Regular: Default enemy with average speed and damage.
- Tank: High health but low speed enemy.
- Assault: High speed but low life enemy.

Additionally, every a certain amount of waves a boss enemy will spawn. The boss will have considerably higher health than any other enemy, but they spawn alone or with a small group of assistants.

Every enemy mentioned above has different tiers, increasing some of their stats. For example, a tier 3 tank would have twice the health and damage than a tier 1 tank.
Tiers can be represented by different colors on the enemy clothes.
