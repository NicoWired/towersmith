# Maps
Maps must have the following components:
- A castle.
- One or more enemy spawn points.
- A road leading from the spawn point to the castle. This is the path enemies will follow.
- Grass tiles where the player can place buidlings.

Additionally, they can have water tiles which are not suitable for enemy movement nor building placement, and any sort of decorations.

Maps are the main factor determining the difficulty of a level. They can alter it by the following means:
- Amount of spawn points.
- Distance from spawn to the castle.
- Grass tile availability near the paths.
- How direct the paths are. The more twists and turns, the more time the player has to shoot down enemies.
