# Game principles
This is a stub of the game principles guiding Towersmith's design.

- **No tutorials**: The game should be intuitive enough to be learnt through trial and error.
- **Simple controls**: The game should be playable with just a mouse, this allows it to be easily played on mobile and handheld devices. Additional hotkeys can be added for PC users for convenience, but shouldn't feel mandatory.
- **Meaningful choices**: The game's all about choosing the right locations for the right buildings with and the right upgrades. It's perfectly fine if early levels can be beaten by just spamming towers everywhere, but this souldn't be the case on the more challenging levels.
- **Non-deterministic**: There should be enough random elements to prevent the player from determining the outcome of a level before they even play it. The player should feel like they need to adapt to the situation at hand, rather than being able to plan everything ahead of time. Random item drops enabling unique towers and limit breaks play a big role. Random monster power ups also add some flavor.
